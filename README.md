# Shared control of a teleoperated echographic probe

##Introduction
This work focuses on developing a shared control system for a teleoperated echographic probe integrated with the Franka Emika Panda Robot. To achieve this, we will derive an impedance control law that meets the compliance requirements for the specified tasks. We will then implement a shared control architecture to enhance the collaboration between the manipulator and the human operator. Additionally, we will design several trajectories and approaches for the scanning task, ensuring it can be performed safely and autonomously. This study aims to demonstrate the advantages of shared control in critical scenarios, where effective collaboration between human and robot is essential for precise task execution and the prevention of hazardous situations.
